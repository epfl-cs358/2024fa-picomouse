We had to copy some library in our repository to avoid issues with versions :
1. gyroscope : code/src/DF_RobotBMI160.cpp, source : [DFRobot repository][https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_BMI160]
2. ToF : code/src/DF_RobotVL6180X.cpp, source : [DFRobot repository][https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_VL6180X]
